Markdown to-do lists ftw!


### How to Use
-------------------------
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it onto your machine
3. Customize `template.md` 
4. When you're ready to start a new list run `./new.py`
5. After running `./new.py` your current `todo.md` will be created
6. The next time you run `./new.py` your current todo will be renamed to `todo<created-date>.md` and moved to `Archive` then a fresh `todo.md` will be generated for you
7. *(Optional)* Push to Github to backup your todos online
